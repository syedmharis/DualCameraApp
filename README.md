The issue:

Let's go through it step by step:

1. React Native and Native Modules:
   React Native allows you to write mobile apps using JavaScript and React. However, sometimes you need to access device-specific features (like the camera) that aren't available in JavaScript. That's where native modules come in.

2. Native Modules:
   These are pieces of code written in the native language of the platform (Swift/Objective-C for iOS, Java/Kotlin for Android) that can be called from your JavaScript code. Your DualCameraModule is an example of a native module.

3. The Bridge:
   The "bridge" in React Native is a mechanism that allows communication between the JavaScript part of your app and the native (iOS/Android) part. It's how your React components can talk to native modules and vice versa.

4. Your DualCameraModule:
   This is a Swift class that interfaces with the device's camera system. It sets up two camera inputs (front and back) and creates preview layers for each.

5. Key parts of the DualCameraModule:
   - `setupMultiCamSession()`: This method sets up the camera session, configuring both front and back cameras.
   - `startSession()` and `stopSession()`: These methods start and stop the camera capture.
   - `addPreviewLayers()`: This method takes the tags of two views from your React Native component and adds the camera preview layers to these views.

6. The React Native Component (App.js):
   This is where you create the UI for your app. It sets up two view references (frontRef and backRef) which will display the camera feeds.

7. Connecting React Native to Native Code:
   In your App.js, you use `NativeModules.DualCameraModule` to call the methods you've defined in your Swift code. React Native handles the communication between JavaScript and Swift behind the scenes.

8. The Flow:
   - Your React Native component renders two views.
   - It then calls the native module to start the camera session and add preview layers.
   - The native module sets up the cameras and attaches their outputs to the views in your React Native UI.

The main challenge in this setup is correctly bridging between the React Native (JavaScript) world and the native (Swift) world. That's why we had to be careful about how we passed view references and how we accessed them in the native code.

This setup allows you to have a powerful, native camera implementation while still using React Native for most of your app's logic and UI. It's a bit complex, especially if you're new to React Native, but it gives you a lot of flexibility and performance for features that need to interact closely with the device hardware.


# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
